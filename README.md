# currency_converter

This is a currency converter project that takes a base currency, amount, and a target conversion currency. I am using it to plan a trip to Mexico. 

Some things to add for the future are:

Historical Exchange Rates – Allow users to view past exchange rates by fetching historical data from the API.

Graphical Representation – Integrate a library like Matplotlib to display exchange rate trends over time.

Multiple Conversions – Instead of converting to just one currency, allow users to convert to multiple currencies at once.

Real-Time Updates – Implement a feature that refreshes exchange rates at regular intervals.

Error Handling Enhancements – Provide more detailed error messages, including handling network issues or invalid API responses.

User Interface (GUI) – Convert your CLI-based program into a graphical application using Tkinter or JavaFX for better usability.

Currency Symbols & Formatting – Ensure converted amounts are displayed with appropriate currency symbols and rounding options.

Saving User Preferences – Store users' most frequently used currency pairs and automatically suggest them.

Offline Mode with Cached Data – Save the most recent exchange rates so users can access them even without internet.

Voice Input & Text-to-Speech – Enable users to speak their queries instead of typing, making it hands-free.
